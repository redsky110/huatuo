## 🚀 Quick Start

This guide uses `build/docker/docker-compose.yml` to start all services, create a host CPU profiling job, and view the flame graph in Grafana.

### 1. Start Services

First, configure Elasticsearch credentials so that huatuo-bamai and huatuo-apiserver can persist profile data. The config files are volume-mounted into the containers, so edit them directly in the project root.

In `huatuo-bamai.conf`:
```toml
[HTTPServer.Auth]
    BearerToken = "REPLACE_WITH_NODE_TOKEN"

[Storage]
    [Storage.Elasticsearch]
        Address = "http://127.0.0.1:9200"
        Index = "huatuo_bamai"
        Username = "elastic"
        Password = "huatuo-bamai"
```

In `huatuo-apiserver.conf`:
```toml
[Agent.Auth]
    BearerToken = "REPLACE_WITH_NODE_TOKEN"

[Elasticsearch]
    Address = "http://127.0.0.1:9200"
    Username = "elastic"
    Password = "huatuo-bamai"
    Index = "huatuo_bamai"

[Auth]
    [[Auth.Users]]
        ID = "administrator"
        BearerToken = "REPLACE_WITH_RANDOM_HEX"
        Admin = true
```

Then start all services from the project root:

```bash
docker compose --project-directory ./build/docker up
```

> Run without `-d` to observe startup logs. Add `-d` for background mode.

| Service | Role | Default Port |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `huatuo-bamai` | Agent, runs profiler sampling | `19704` |
| `huatuo-apiserver` | API entry point, creates and dispatches jobs | `12740` |
| `elasticsearch` | Stores profile data (index: `huatuo_bamai`) | `9200` |
| `grafana` | Flame graph visualization | `3000` |

### 2. Verify Services

In a new terminal, confirm all services are ready:

```bash
# Agent health check
$ curl -s http://localhost:19704/version | jq .data.name

"huatuo-bamai"

# API Server health check
$ curl -s http://localhost:12740/version | jq .data.name

"huatuo-apiserver"

# ES index status
$ curl -s -u elastic:huatuo-bamai "http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices/huatuo_bamai?v"

health status index        uuid                   pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size dataset.size
yellow open   huatuo_bamai 147fzHJhQ820GjCKFLh5ZQ   1   1         42            0    297.8kb        297.8kb      297.8kb
```

Set environment variables for subsequent API calls:

```bash
API_BASE="http://127.0.0.1:12740"
API_TOKEN="REPLACE_WITH_RANDOM_HEX"
```

### 3. Create a Host CPU Profiling Job

Use `c` language (native, covers C/C++/Go) to sample the entire host for 30 seconds:

```bash
# Use the actual hostname of the node
HOSTNAME=$(hostname)

JOB_ID=$(curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"type\": \"cpu\",
    \"language\": \"c\",
    \"mode\": \"oncpu\",
    \"scope\": \"host\",
    \"duration_seconds\": 30,
    \"hostname\": \"${HOSTNAME}\"
  }" \
  "${API_BASE}/v1/profiling" | jq -r .data.request_id)

echo "Job ID: $JOB_ID"
```

### 4. Verify Data in Elasticsearch

Each aggregation window is 10 seconds. A 30-second job produces approximately 3 profile documents. Wait for completion, then verify:

```bash
$ curl -s -u elastic:huatuo-bamai "http://localhost:9200/huatuo_bamai/_count" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":{"exists":{"field":"profile_data.profile"}}}' | jq .count

3
```

### 5. View the Flame Graph in Grafana

Open the **Continuous Profiling (host)** dashboard:

- URL: [http://localhost:3000/d/continuous-profiling-host](http://localhost:3000/d/continuous-profiling-host) (replace `localhost:3000` with your environment)
- Credentials: `admin / admin` (skip the default password change prompt)

Steps:

1. Select a time range covering the profiling period
2. Choose your `hostname` and set `type` to `process_cpu:cpu:nanoseconds:cpu:nanoseconds`
3. The flame graph loads aggregated call stacks for the selected time range and updates dynamically
4. Click a frame to zoom in; use the top table for symbol sorting, filtering, and statistics

For more profiling dimensions, see the Profiling API section below.

## 🌐 Profiling API

huatuo-apiserver exposes `/v1/profiling` for creating, observing, and stopping
Profiling Jobs. Each create request is an independent execution. The Job is
durable in huatuo-apiserver while the Node owns only the in-memory Operation
and profiler process.

Elasticsearch is optional for Job control but required for raw results and
Dashboard links. Node and Apiserver must use the same Elasticsearch index.

### 1. Request Conventions

By default, huatuo-apiserver listens on `:12740`. The following examples use environment variables for the server address and bearer token:

```bash
API_BASE="http://127.0.0.1:12740"
API_TOKEN="REPLACE_WITH_RANDOM_HEX"
```

Every request must pass the configured bearer token:

```text
Authorization: Bearer REPLACE_WITH_RANDOM_HEX
```

A non-administrator user requires both `/v1/profiling` and
`/v1/profiling/**` permissions. Permissions may include an HTTP method, such as
`GET /v1/profiling/**`. Successful responses contain only `data`:

```json
{
  "data": {}
}
```

Error responses contain a stable code and a human-readable message:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "result_unavailable",
    "message": "Job state does not provide a complete Profiling result"
  }
}
```

Clients must branch on `error.code` and must not parse `error.message`.

### 2. Query Profiling Capabilities

Before creating a job, query the profiling types, languages, CPU modes, memory modes, and runtime settings supported by the server:

```bash
curl -sS \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \
  "${API_BASE}/v1/profiling/capabilities"
```

`data.items` is a static versioned capability table. Each item contains:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `type` | Profiling type: `cpu` or `memory` |
| `language` | Target language |
| `modes` | Valid `mode` values for this type/language pair |
| `supports_binary_match` | Whether `binary_match_path` is accepted |
| `supported_scopes` | Valid values for `scope` |

CPU profiling supports `oncpu` and `offcpu` for `c`, `c++`, and `go`;
`java` and `python` support only `oncpu`. Memory profiling supports these combinations:

| Language | `mode` | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `c`, `c++`, `go` | `virtual_alloc` | Virtual address-space allocation |
| `c`, `c++`, `go` | `physical_alloc` | Physical page allocation |
| `c`, `c++`, `go` | `physical_usage` | Current physical page residency |
| `java` | `object_alloc` | JVM object allocation |
| `java` | `object_usage` | JVM live objects |

### 3. Create a Profiling Job

`POST /v1/profiling` accepts the following JSON fields:

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | Yes | Profiling type: `cpu` or `memory` |
| `language` | Yes | Target process language; it must support the selected profiling type |
| `mode` | Yes | One mode advertised for the selected type/language pair |
| `duration_seconds` | Yes | Profiling duration in seconds |
| `hostname` | Yes | Hostname of the node running the target process; used for job scheduling |
| `scope` | Yes | `host` or `container`, as advertised by capabilities |
| `container_id` | For container scope | Target container ID |
| `binary_match_path` | No | Executable path matcher when the capability permits it |

Each request creates a new Job, even when its content matches an earlier request.
Per-host and process-wide quotas reject excess active Jobs with HTTP 429.

Create a Go CPU profiling job on a host:

```bash
curl -sS -i \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "cpu",
    "language": "go",
    "mode": "oncpu",
    "scope": "host",
    "duration_seconds": 60,
    "hostname": "node-01"
  }' \
  "${API_BASE}/v1/profiling"
```

Create a Java live-object profiling job in a container:

```bash
curl -sS -i \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "memory",
    "language": "java",
    "mode": "object_usage",
    "scope": "container",
    "duration_seconds": 60,
    "container_id": "9f4c2f1a8b7d",
    "hostname": "node-01"
  }' \
  "${API_BASE}/v1/profiling"
```

A successful request returns `201 Created`. The `Location` response header identifies the new job, and the response body contains the job ID used by subsequent requests:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "request_id": "<profile-job-id>",
    "hostname": "node-01",
    "duration_seconds": 60,
    "scope": "host",
    "type": "cpu",
    "language": "go",
    "mode": "oncpu",
    "status": "pending",
    "created_at": "2026-08-24T10:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2026-08-24T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

```bash
JOB_ID="<profile-job-id>"
```

### 4. List Profiling Jobs

`GET /v1/profiling` supports these query parameters:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `limit` | `100` | Page size; must be between 1 and 1000 |
| `offset` | `0` | Starting offset; must be greater than or equal to 0 |

List the 20 most recent Profiling Jobs:

```bash
curl -sS -G \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \
  --data-urlencode "limit=20" \
  --data-urlencode "offset=0" \
  "${API_BASE}/v1/profiling"
```

The server always limits the result to Profiling Jobs and orders them by
`created_at` descending. `data.items` contains the job array. `data.limit` and
`data.offset` are the effective pagination parameters, and `data.has_more`
indicates whether another page is available. Non-administrator users can list
only jobs they created.

### 5. Get a Profiling Job

```bash
curl -sS \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \
  "${API_BASE}/v1/profiling/${JOB_ID}"
```

The `data` object contains the job details:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `request_id` | Profiling Job ID used by all follow-up requests |
| `container_id` | Target container ID; omitted for host jobs |
| `hostname` | Target node hostname |
| `duration_seconds` | Requested profiling duration in seconds |
| `scope` | `host` or `container` |
| `type` | `cpu` or `memory` |
| `language` | Target process language |
| `mode` | Profiling mode selected from the capability table |
| `binary_match_path` | Executable path matcher; omitted when unused |
| `status` | Current job status |
| `terminal` | Terminal details `{outcome, reason, message}`; omitted while active |
| `created_at` | Job creation time |
| `updated_at` | Last Job state update time |
| `started_at` | Time execution started; omitted until observed running |
| `ended_at` | Terminal status time; omitted while the job is active |
| `result_url` | Dashboard URL returned by the detail endpoint when a complete result is available |

Profiling jobs use these statuses:

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pending` | The job has been created and is waiting for the Agent |
| `running` | The Agent is collecting profiling data |
| `stopping` | A stop request has been persisted and is being applied asynchronously |
| `terminal` | The job has ended; inspect `terminal.outcome` for the result |

`terminal.outcome` is `completed`, `failed`, `stopped`, or `unknown`. For
`failed`, inspect `terminal.reason` and `terminal.message`. `stopped` means the
job was actively stopped and its result may be incomplete. `unknown` means the
Apiserver cannot verify the final Operation status, but a durably published
result may still be available.

`operation_lost` and `execution_timed_out` are terminal reason codes, not Job
statuses. Other failure codes include pending or stop deadline expiry, Node
unavailability, execution-capacity exhaustion, start or execution failure,
`invalid_node_request` for a Node request constructed incorrectly by the
Apiserver, and protocol errors.

### 6. Get Raw Profiling Data

`GET /v1/profiling/:request_id/raw` returns raw profiling windows only for a
Job whose `terminal.outcome` is `completed` or `unknown` and whose durable
publication marker exists. A missing or expired marker returns
`result_not_found`. Active Jobs return `result_not_ready`; `failed` and
`stopped` Jobs return
`result_unavailable`.

The response can be large, so it can be written directly to a file:

```bash
curl -sS \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \
  -o profile-raw.json \
  "${API_BASE}/v1/profiling/${JOB_ID}/raw?limit=100&offset=0"
```

The profiling windows are in `data.items`; `data.limit`, `data.offset`, and
`data.has_more` describe the page. Each item contains `uploaded_timestamp`,
`started_timestamp`, `profile_type`, and the pprof-compatible `profile` payload.
An empty, durably published result is a successful response with an empty
`items` array. `limit` defaults to 20 and cannot exceed 100. If the encoded
profile data exceeds 64 MiB, the server returns `413 result_too_large`; retry
with a smaller `limit`.

### 7. Stop a Profiling Job

Stop is an asynchronous intent. It is accepted for `pending`, `running`, or
already `stopping` Jobs:

```bash
curl -sS \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \
  "${API_BASE}/v1/profiling/${JOB_ID}/stop"
```

A successful request returns `200 OK` with the current Job snapshot. A terminal
Job returns `409 Conflict`. Stopped Jobs do not expose results because their
final data may be incomplete.

## 📖 profiler CLI Overview

`profiler` is HUATUO's standalone performance profiling CLI. It samples host processes or processes inside containers without requiring huatuo-apiserver, Elasticsearch, or Grafana. The tool supports C, C++, Go, Java, and Python processes and writes call stacks as folded stacks or SVG flame graphs.

C, C++, and Go use the eBPF-based native collector to observe on-CPU usage, off-CPU blocking and scheduling delay, virtual memory allocation, physical memory allocation, and physical memory residency. Java uses async-profiler to observe CPU usage, object allocation, and live objects. Python uses py-spy to observe CPU usage. The results can be used to locate hot functions, attribute memory growth, analyze processes inside containers, and preserve performance data for later diagnosis.

The remainder of this section covers standalone use of `_output/bin/profiler`. For service-based continuous profiling, see the Profiling API section above.

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. Locate CPU Hotspots and Call Paths

Sample the call stacks of C, C++, Go, Java, or Python processes at a fixed frequency and use stack width to identify the primary consumers of CPU time. The native collector can also limit sampling to selected CPUs with `--cpuid`, which is useful for analyzing CPU-pinned workloads or per-CPU hotspots.

### 2. Attribute Native Process Memory

Observe virtual address-space allocation, physical page allocation, and current physical page residency for C, C++, and Go processes. These modes distinguish between how much address space was requested, how much physical memory was allocated, and how much physical memory remains resident. They help locate call paths responsible for `mmap` activity, page-fault allocation, and resident memory growth.

### 3. Analyze JVM Object Allocation and Live Objects

Use async-profiler to collect Java object allocation or live-object call stacks. Object allocation profiles help locate high allocation rates and sources of GC pressure. Live-object profiles help identify objects that remain referenced during the collection window and the paths where they were allocated.

### 4. Analyze Containers and Multi-process Workloads

Use a container ID to resolve and profile target processes inside Docker or containerd workloads. Java and Python also accept comma-separated PID lists and can limit the number of concurrently running collector subprocesses, which is useful for service replicas and parent-child process groups.

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Build and Runtime Requirements

Build all artifacts from the repository root:

```bash
make build
```

The resulting executable is `_output/bin/profiler`. Native profiling depends on Linux eBPF, perf events, and the BPF objects built from this repository. It generally requires root privileges and a `kernel.perf_event_paranoid` setting that permits sampling. Java profiling requires async-profiler; `--tool-path` points to the shared tool root containing `bin/asprof` and `lib/libasyncProfiler.so`. Python profiling requires `py-spy` under the same root.

Display the complete help for the current version:

```bash
_output/bin/profiler --help
```

The basic command structure is:

```bash
sudo _output/bin/profiler \
  --type <cpu|memory> \
  --language <c|c++|go|java|python> \
  --pid <pid> \
  --duration 30 \
  --aggr-interval 10 \
  --output-format flamegraph \
  --output-path ./profiles
```

`--type` and `--language` are required. Java, Python, and native memory profiling require exactly one target specified with either `--pid` or `--container-id`. Native CPU profiling can sample the entire host when neither target is specified.

| Option | Default | Scope | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--memory-mode` | None | Native memory, Java memory | Memory profiling mode; required with `--type memory` |
| `--cpuid` | All CPUs | Native CPU | Comma-separated CPU list or ranges; off-CPU samples use the task's switch-out CPU |
| `--cpu-mode` | `oncpu` | Native CPU | `oncpu` for frequency sampling or `offcpu` for blocked/runqueue time attribution |
| `--require-hardware-pmu` | `false` | Native on-CPU | Require hardware PMU sampling; fail instead of falling back to the software CPU clock |
| `--offcpu-phase` | `all` | Native off-CPU | Accumulate `all`, `blocked`, or `runqueue` time |
| `--offcpu-min-duration-us` | `1000` | Native off-CPU | Discard phases shorter than this duration in microseconds |
| `--offcpu-stats` | `false` | Native off-CPU | Collect BPF diagnostic statistics; adds overhead to error and cleanup paths |

| `--log-file` | `stdout` | Log file path, or `stdout` |
| `--log-size` | `100` | Log rotation size in MB; `0` disables rotation; applies only to file output |
| `--verbose` | `false` | Equivalent to `--log-level debug --log-file stdout` and overrides both explicit logging options |

### 3. Observing C, C++, and Go

C, C++, and Go use the same native eBPF collector; only the `--language` value changes. CPU mode counts call-stack samples and includes user-space and kernel-space stacks when symbols can be resolved.

```bash
sudo _output/bin/profiler \
  --type cpu \
  --language go \
  --pid 12345 \
  --duration 30 \
  --aggr-interval 10 \
  --freq 99 \
  --output-format flamegraph \
  --output-path ./profiles/go-cpu
```

Add `--thread-group` to include worker threads in the same process. Add `--cpuid 2,4-7` to limit collection to selected CPUs. Native CPU profiling also supports container-level and host-level collection:

Native on-CPU profiling first uses hardware CPU-cycle events and falls back to
the software CPU clock when the hardware PMU is unavailable. `--freq` remains
samples per second for either source. Use `--require-hardware-pmu` when software
clock fallback would hide IRQ-disabled CPU time.

```bash
# Profile a specific container
sudo _output/bin/profiler \
  --type cpu --language c --container-id <container-id> \
  --duration 30 --aggr-interval 10 \
  --output-format collapsed --output-path ./profiles/container

# Profile the host without specifying a PID or container
sudo _output/bin/profiler \
  --type cpu --language c \
  --duration 30 --aggr-interval 10 \
  --output-format flamegraph --output-path ./profiles/host
```

To attribute time spent outside the CPU to the call path that descheduled, select off-CPU mode:

```bash
sudo _output/bin/profiler \
  --type cpu --language go --pid 12345 --thread-group \
  --cpu-mode offcpu --offcpu-phase all \
  --cpuid 2,4-7 \
  --offcpu-min-duration-us 1000 \
  --duration 30 --aggr-interval 10 \
  --output-format flamegraph --output-path ./profiles/go-offcpu
```

Off-CPU output is event-driven, so `--freq` does not apply. With `--cpuid`, an interval is collected only when the task switches out from a selected CPU; later wakeup or switch-in on another CPU does not change that attribution. Flame graphs use nanoseconds directly and add roots such as `off-CPU blocked`, `scheduling delay (preempted)`, and `scheduling delay (yielded)`. The `all` phase includes blocked and runqueue time but keeps them separated by these roots. A single stable BPF stack map is used so a long sleep cannot be resolved against a later rotating stack-map generation.

Native memory profiling supports these dimensions:

| `--memory-mode` | Measurement | Suitable for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `virtual_alloc` | Virtual address-space allocation and its call stacks | Excessive `mmap` activity and address-space growth |
| `physical_alloc` | Physical memory newly allocated during the collection window | Physical page allocation triggered by page faults and allocation-rate analysis |
| `physical_usage` | Physical memory still resident at collection time | Sources of resident memory and paths retaining physical pages |

```bash
sudo _output/bin/profiler \
  --type memory \
  --language c++ \
  --memory-mode physical_usage \
  --pid 12345 \
  --thread-group \
  --physical-memory-probability 100 \
  --duration 30 \
  --aggr-interval 10 \
  --output-format flamegraph \
  --output-path ./profiles/native-memory
```

`--physical-memory-probability` applies only to `physical_alloc` and `physical_usage`. Lowering it reduces processing for high-frequency memory events, but flame-graph values are then estimates based on sampled events rather than counts of every event.

### 4. Observing Java

Java CPU profiling depends on async-profiler. It supports a single PID, a container, or multiple PIDs:

```bash
_output/bin/profiler \
  --type cpu \
  --language java \
  --pid 12345,12346 \
  --tool-path /opt/huatuo/tools \
  --max-concurrent-procs 2 \
  --duration 30 \
  --aggr-interval 10 \
  --freq 99 \
  --output-format flamegraph \
  --output-path ./profiles/java-cpu
```

Java memory profiling supports two dimensions:

| `--memory-mode` | Measurement | Suitable for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `object_alloc` | Objects allocated during the collection window and their allocation call stacks | High allocation rates, short-lived objects, and sources of GC pressure |
| `object_usage` | Live objects and their allocation call stacks | Long-lived objects, sources of heap usage, and suspected memory leaks |

```bash
_output/bin/profiler \
  --type memory \
  --language java \
  --memory-mode object_usage \
  --pid 12345 \
  --tool-path /opt/huatuo/tools \
  --duration 30 \
  --aggr-interval 10 \
  --output-format flamegraph \
  --output-path ./profiles/java-memory
```

To target a container, replace `--pid` with `--container-id <container-id>`. If a container has multiple candidate processes, use `--binary-match-path` to select the target executable path.

### 5. Observing Python

Python currently supports CPU profiling only. `--aggr-interval` must equal `--duration`, so one collection produces one aggregation window. `--tool-path` points to the shared tool root containing `py-spy`.

```bash
_output/bin/profiler \
  --type cpu \

Python does not support `--type memory`. Use a separate memory analysis tool for Python memory profiling; the current `profiler` command does not invoke memray to generate Python memory profiles.

### 6. Choosing a Flame Graph and Output Format

| Format | Output | When to use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `collapsed` | `perf_<Unix timestamp>.folded`; each line contains a semicolon-separated call stack followed by a count | Scripted searches, result comparison, or rendering later with another flame-graph tool |
| `flamegraph` | `flamegraph_<Unix timestamp>.svg`; an SVG with embedded interaction scripts | Default format for manual analysis; supports searching, zooming, and inspecting frame values in a browser |
| `svg` | The same interactive SVG as `flamegraph` | Compatibility with callers that explicitly request SVG; currently equivalent to `flamegraph` |
| `remote` | No local flame graph; uploads pprof-compatible data through a Unix socket | Integration with the HUATUO storage pipeline; not suitable for offline viewing |

A flame graph shows the call direction from bottom to top. Rectangle width represents the cumulative value for that call stack in the selected profiling mode. For CPU profiles, width represents the proportion of CPU time derived from sample counts. For memory profiles, it represents virtual allocation, physical allocation, physical residency, Java object allocation, or live-object volume, depending on the selected mode. Horizontal position does not represent chronological order.

Example folded stacks:

```text
main;handleRequest;parsePayload 428
main;handleRequest;writeResponse 172
```

Choose `collapsed` when you need to retain raw data and later render it with different colors or filters. Choose `flamegraph` when you want to inspect hotspots directly. `remote` depends on the HUATUO toolstream Unix socket, requires a non-empty `--tracer-id`, and should not be selected for standalone offline use.

### 7. Reproducing Integration Test Examples

The repository's integration tests provide executable end-to-end examples. Each test creates a target process, runs profiler, and verifies the expected call stack in the output:

```bash
# Native CPU
sudo ./integration/run.sh test_profiler_native_cpu.sh

# Native off-CPU blocking and scheduling delay
sudo ./integration/run.sh test_profiler_native_cpu_offcpu.sh

# Native virtual and physical memory
sudo ./integration/run.sh test_profiler_native_memory_virtual_alloc.sh
sudo ./integration/run.sh test_profiler_native_memory_physical_usage.sh

# Java CPU and memory
sudo ./integration/run.sh test_profiler_java_cpu_multi_pid.sh
sudo ./integration/run.sh test_profiler_java_memory_usage_alloc.sh

# Python multi-process CPU
sudo ./integration/run.sh test_profiler_python_cpu_multi_pid.sh
```

Container, thread-group, and CPU-selection examples are available in `test_profiler_native_cpu_container.sh`, `test_profiler_native_cpu_thread_group.sh`, and `test_profiler_native_cpu_cpuid.sh`, respectively. Run `make build` first and configure the Java or Python profiler path in `integration/env.sh` as needed.

## ⚙️ How It Works

`profiler` first selects a collector based on the language and profile type. The native on-CPU collector attaches eBPF programs to perf events; off-CPU mode attaches scheduler switch, wakeup, exit, and task-free tracepoints. Native memory collectors record allocation and release paths through kernel events. The Java and Python collectors start async-profiler and py-spy subprocesses, respectively. Collected records enter a common aggregation pipeline, which merges counts by call stack and then writes a local file or uploads the result to remote storage.

    CLI[profiler CLI options] --> Select{Language and profile type}
    Select -->|C/C++/Go| Native[Native eBPF collector]
    Select -->|Java| Java[async-profiler]
    Select -->|Python| Python[py-spy]
    Native --> Queue[Sample record queue]
    Java --> Queue
    Python --> Queue
    Queue --> Aggregate[Aggregate by call stack]
    Aggregate --> Folded[Collapsed stacks]
    Aggregate --> SVG[Interactive SVG flame graph]
    Aggregate --> Remote[Remote upload through Unix socket]
```

`--duration` controls the collection lifetime, while `--aggr-interval` controls the snapshot interval for remote uploads. Local `collapsed`, `flamegraph`, and `svg` modes write the final aggregate when collection ends. `remote` creates and uploads snapshots at the aggregation interval. The queue decouples collection from symbolization, aggregation, and output so file rendering does not block the sampling path.
