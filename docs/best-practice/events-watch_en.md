{{% /alert %}}

## 📖 Overview

`/v1/events/watch` is HUATUO's real-time kernel event subscription endpoint. A single HTTP POST long-lived connection streams kernel anomaly events from the node continuously. Events are wrapped in the [CloudEvents 1.0](https://cloudevents.io/) specification and delivered via the [Server-Sent Events (SSE)](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html) protocol.

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

Kernel event subscription surfaces OS-level anomaly signals directly to higher-level systems, eliminating the latency and overhead of traditional polling. The following are typical integration scenarios.

### Fault Self-Healing

Kernel events are the primary signal source for self-healing decisions. After subscribing to `events/watch`, a healing controller can trigger remediation the moment an event occurs, without waiting for an alert to propagate through a monitoring pipeline:

- **OOM self-healing**: On receiving a `memory_oom` event, immediately scale, restart, or drain traffic from the triggering container. Reduces service interruption from minutes to seconds.
- **Hung task self-healing**: On receiving a `hungtask` event, automatically cordon the node and evict Pods to prevent cascading blockage from spreading across the cluster.
- **Network fault self-healing**: On receiving a `netdev_txqueue_timeout` or `netdev_bonding_lacp` event, trigger a NIC reset or traffic failover to restore the network link within minutes.
- **I/O storm self-healing**: On receiving an `iotracing` event, dynamically throttle the affected container's disk I/O quota via cgroup blkio to protect co-located services on the same node.

### Observability Platforms

Integrating HUATUO kernel events into an observability platform adds a kernel-level perspective beyond application metrics and logs:

- **Event timeline correlation**: Overlay `softlockup`, `memory_oom`, and other kernel events onto Grafana timelines, aligning them precisely with application error rates and latency curves for root-cause analysis.
- **Anomaly-driven alerting**: Replace fixed-threshold alerts with kernel events to reduce false positives. For example, a `ras` hardware error event triggers a high-priority alert directly, without relying on a CPU error rate crossing a threshold.
- **Capacity and stability analysis**: Subscribe to `memburst`, `dload`, and other AutoTracing events over time to establish a node stability baseline and provide kernel-level data for capacity planning.
- **Multi-dimensional drill-down**: Events carry container ID, namespace, region, and other context fields. Alert links can drill down directly to the corresponding Pod, Node, or Region view.

### Security Auditing and Compliance

- **Anomalous behavior detection**: A cluster of `memory_oom`, `hungtask`, or `softlockup` events outside business peak hours may indicate resource abuse or a malicious workload, triggering a security review workflow.
- **Event retention and traceability**: Write the CloudEvents stream to a message queue (Kafka, Pulsar) or object storage to satisfy the event retention requirements of security compliance frameworks.

### Chaos Engineering and Load Testing

- **Fault injection verification**: After injecting network latency or memory pressure via a chaos engineering platform, subscribe to `net_rx_latency` and `memburst` events in real time to verify the fault is active, replacing manual observation.
- **Load test baseline**: Subscribe to all events during a load test. The timestamp of the first kernel anomaly event precisely marks the system's stress threshold.

### AIOps

- **Event-driven root-cause analysis**: Feed kernel events as features into AI/ML models alongside application metrics for multi-dimensional root-cause inference, reducing manual investigation time.
- **Predictive maintenance**: Model `ras` hardware errors and `netdev_bonding_lacp` hardware-layer events to detect anomalies before a device fails completely, triggering proactive migration.
- **Intelligent suppression and aggregation**: Automatically aggregate similar events within the same time window to avoid alert storms. Deliver a concise root-cause summary to on-call engineers.

### 3. POST Request Reference

#### 3.1 Endpoint

```http
POST /v1/events/watch
```

#### 3.2 Request Headers

```http
Authorization: Bearer <node-token>
Content-Type: application/json
```

#### 3.3 Request Body

```json
{
  "filters": {
    "tracer_name": "<regex>",
    "hostname": "<regex>",
    "container_hostname": "<regex>",
    "container_host_namespace": "<regex>",
    "container_qos": "<regex>",
    "region": "<regex>"
  }
}
```

**`filters` field reference:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tracer_name` | string | No | Filter by tracer name; supports regular expressions |
| `hostname` | string | No | Filter by node hostname; supports regular expressions |
| `container_hostname` | string | No | Filter by container hostname; supports regular expressions |
| `container_host_namespace` | string | No | Filter by container namespace; supports regular expressions |
| `container_qos` | string | No | Filter by container QoS; supports regular expressions |
| `region` | string | No | Filter by region; supports regular expressions |

- All filter fields are optional. Omitting or leaving a field empty matches all values.
- When multiple fields are specified, all conditions must be satisfied simultaneously (AND semantics).
- Filters are evaluated server-side; only matching events are pushed to the client.

#### 3.4 Response Format (SSE Stream)

After the connection is established, the server continuously pushes events in SSE format:

```text
data: {"specversion":"1.0","id":"...","source":"/huatuo/node-1/memory_oom",...}\n\n
```

The server also sends periodic heartbeat comment lines to keep the connection alive:

```text
: ping\n
```

---

### 4. HTTP Server Event Stream Configuration

Configure the event stream controls under `[HTTPServer]`:

```toml
[HTTPServer]
    # Maximum number of concurrent client connections. New connections receive HTTP 429 when the limit is reached.
    # Default: 100
    MaxEventStreamClients = 100

    # SSE heartbeat interval in seconds. Prevents proxies and load balancers from closing idle connections.
    # The connection is closed after three consecutive heartbeat write failures.
    # Default: 30
    EventStreamKeepAliveIntervalSeconds = 30
```

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MaxEventStreamClients` | 100 | Maximum concurrent `/v1/events/watch` connections. Excess connections receive HTTP 429. |
| `EventStreamKeepAliveIntervalSeconds` | 30 | Heartbeat interval. Keep it below the upstream proxy's idle timeout. |

---

### 5. curl Examples

#### 5.1 Subscribe to All Kernel Events

```bash
curl -s -N -X POST http://<node-ip>:19704/v1/events/watch \

  -H "Connection: keep-alive" \
  -d '{}'
```

#### 5.2 Subscribe to OOM Events Only

```bash
curl -s -N -X POST http://<node-ip>:19704/v1/events/watch \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <node-token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \

  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" \
  -H "Connection: keep-alive" \
  -d '{
    "filters": {
      "container_host_namespace": "^prod$"
    }
  }'
```

> **Note:** The `-N` flag disables curl buffering, causing SSE events to be printed to the terminal immediately.

### 6. Generated Go Client Example

`POST /v1/events/watch` is part of the Node OpenAPI contract. The generated
client supplies the request and event types used below.

```go
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"context"
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"log/slog"
	"net/http"
	"os"
	"strings"
	"time"

	nodeapi "github.com/ccfos/huatuo/apis/v1/node"
)

func watchEvents(
	ctx context.Context,
	baseURL string,
	token string,
	filters nodeapi.WatchEventFilters,
) error {
	client, err := nodeapi.NewClient(
		baseURL,
		nodeapi.WithHTTPClient(&http.Client{}),
		nodeapi.WithRequestEditorFn(func(_ context.Context, request *http.Request) error {
			request.Header.Set("Authorization", "Bearer "+token)
			request.Header.Set("Accept", "text/event-stream")
			return nil
		}),
	)
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("create Node API client: %w", err)
	}
	resp, err := client.WatchEvents(ctx, nodeapi.WatchEventsJSONRequestBody{
		Filters: &filters,
	})
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("connect: %w", err)
	}
	defer resp.Body.Close()

	if resp.StatusCode != http.StatusOK {
		return fmt.Errorf("unexpected status: %d", resp.StatusCode)
	}

	scanner := bufio.NewScanner(resp.Body)
	for scanner.Scan() {
		line := scanner.Text()

		// skip heartbeat comment lines and blank lines
		if line == "" || strings.HasPrefix(line, ":") {
			continue
		}

		// SSE data line format: `data: <json>`
		data, ok := strings.CutPrefix(line, "data: ")
		if !ok {
			continue
		}

		var event nodeapi.WatchEvent
		if err := json.Unmarshal([]byte(data), &event); err != nil {
			slog.Warn("parse event", "err", err)
			continue
		}

		fmt.Printf(
			"[%s] source=%s id=%s\n",
			event.Time.Format(time.RFC3339Nano),
			event.Source,
			event.ID.String(),
		)
		fmt.Printf("  data: %+v\n", event.Data)
	}

	return scanner.Err()
}

func main() {
	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Minute)
	defer cancel()

	tracerName := "memory_oom|hungtask|softlockup"
	err := watchEvents(ctx, "http://192.168.1.10:19704", "node-token", nodeapi.WatchEventFilters{
		TracerName: &tracerName,
	})
	if err != nil {
		slog.Error("watch events", "err", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}
```

#### 6.1 Streaming Client Selection

Use the generated `Client.WatchEvents` method, which returns the raw
`http.Response`. Do not use `ClientWithResponses.WatchEventsWithResponse` for
this endpoint: that helper reads the body to EOF, while an SSE stream normally
remains open until its context is canceled.

#### 6.2 Reconnection

In production, network interruptions or service restarts will drop the connection. Use exponential backoff to reconnect:

```go
func watchWithRetry(
	ctx context.Context,
	baseURL string,
	token string,
	filters nodeapi.WatchEventFilters,
) {
	backoff := time.Second
	for {
		if err := watchEvents(ctx, baseURL, token, filters); err != nil {
			if ctx.Err() != nil {
				return
			}
			slog.Warn("disconnected, retrying", "err", err, "backoff", backoff)
			// time.NewTimer + Stop releases the timer immediately when the context is cancelled
			timer := time.NewTimer(backoff)
			select {
			case <-ctx.Done():
				timer.Stop()
				return
			case <-timer.C:
			}
			if backoff < 30*time.Second {
				backoff *= 2
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Architecture

HUATUO Agent runs on each node. It hooks into critical kernel paths via eBPF, Kprobe, and Tracepoint, collects kernel anomaly events, applies filters, wraps them as CloudEvents, and pushes them to multiple concurrent SSE subscribers.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph kernel["Linux Kernel"]
        K1[OOM Killer]
        K2[Hung Task Detection]
        K3[Soft Lockup Detection]
        K4[RAS Hardware Errors]
        K5[Network Subsystem]
        K6[AutoTracing]
    end

    subgraph huatuo["HUATUO Agent (per node)"]
        T["Tracer Collection Layer\neBPF / Kprobe / Tracepoint"]
        F["Filter\nhostname / tracer / namespace / region"]
        CE["CloudEvents 1.0 Wrapper\nid / source / time / data"]
        EW["EventsWatch Dispatcher\nSSE connection management"]
    end

    subgraph clients["Subscribers"]
        C1[Fault Self-Healing System]
        C2[Observability Platform]
        C3[AIOps System]
        C4[Security Audit System]
    end

    kernel --> T
    T --> F
    F --> CE
    CE --> EW
    EW -->|SSE push| C1
    EW -->|SSE push| C2
    EW -->|SSE push| C3
    EW -->|SSE push| C4
```

### Event Collection and Push

After the client issues a POST request, the connection stays open. Each time the kernel triggers an anomaly event, HUATUO Agent filters and wraps it, then writes it immediately to all matching SSE streams. No client polling is required.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant EW as EventsWatch
    participant T as Tracer Layer
    participant K as Linux Kernel

    C->>EW: POST /v1/events/watch {"filters": {...}}
    EW-->>C: 200 OK (Content-Type: text/event-stream)

    loop SSE long-lived connection
        K->>T: Kernel event triggered (memory_oom / hungtask / softlockup ...)
        T->>EW: Report raw event
        EW->>EW: Apply filter
        alt Filter matched
            EW-->>C: data: {CloudEvents JSON}\n\n
        else No match
            note over EW: Discard, do not push
        end
        EW-->>C: : ping (keepalive, configured interval)
    end
```

### Event Processing Pipeline

From kernel event generation to client delivery, three stages are involved: collection, filtering, and wrapping. End-to-end latency is under 1 second.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A([Kernel anomaly triggered]) --> B["Tracer collection\neBPF / Kprobe"]
    B --> C{Filter matched?}
    C -- No --> D([Discard])
    C -- Yes --> E["Wrap as CloudEvents 1.0\nid / source / time / data"]
    E --> F[Write to SSE stream]
    F --> G([Push to subscribers])
```
