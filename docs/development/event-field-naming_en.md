Event fields must use consistent semantics before following the naming
conventions of each layer. The same name must not represent different concepts.

## Layer Rules

| Layer | Rule | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BPF C | Names reflect the original kernel semantics and units | `tgid`, `kernel_observed_ns` |
| Go | MixedCaps; initialisms remain uppercase | `TGID`, `KernelObservedNS` |
| JSON | Use user-facing statistical semantics | `pid`, `observed_timestamp` |
| CLI flags | Lowercase kebab case | `--pid`, `--cpuid` |
| CLI text and headers | Use standard uppercase initialisms | `PID`, `CPU`, `COMM` |

## CPUs and Tasks

| Concept | Definition | BPF C | Go | JSON | CLI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Logical CPU number | Number returned by `bpf_get_smp_processor_id()` | `cpu` | `CPU` | `cpu` | `--cpu`, `CPU` |
| Process ID | Userspace process identifier, namely the Linux TGID | `tgid` | `TGID` in raw events; `PID` in output | `pid` | `--pid`, `PID` |
| Thread ID | Linux task PID | `tid` | `TID` | `tid` | `--tid`, `TID` |
| Parent process ID | Parent process TGID | `parent_tgid` | `ParentTGID`, or `ParentPID` in the output layer | `parent_pid` | `PPID` |
| Task comm | Kernel task `comm`, which may be a thread name | `comm` | `Comm` | `comm` | `COMM` |

## Time and Numeric Units

| Concept | Definition | BPF C | Go | JSON |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Raw kernel observation time | `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` nanoseconds, excluding system suspend | `kernel_observed_ns` | `KernelObservedNS` | Internal correlation only; not serialized |
| Kernel observation time | Raw monotonic timestamp converted to UTC | Not applicable | `KernelObservedTimestamp` | `kernel_observed_timestamp` |
| Userspace observation time | UTC time when the event producer observes the event in userspace | Not applicable | `ObservedTimestamp` | `observed_timestamp` |
| Unix nanosecond time | Unix time in nanoseconds | `timestamp_ns` | `TimestampNS` | `timestamp_ns` |
| Nanosecond duration | Difference between two time points | `<name>_ns` | `<Name>NS` | `<name>_ns` |
| Nanosecond threshold | Duration corresponding to a trigger condition | `<name>_threshold_ns` | `<Name>ThresholdNS` | `<name>_threshold_ns` |
| Count | Unitless cumulative value | `<name>_count` | `<Name>Count` | `<name>_count` |
| Bytes | Data size, not bit count | `<name>_bytes` | `<Name>Bytes` | `<name>_bytes` |

## Containers, Cgroups, and Network Namespaces

| Concept | BPF C | Go | JSON | CLI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Container ID | `container_id` | `ContainerID` | `container_id` | `--container-id`, `CONTAINER_ID` |
| Cgroup ID | `cgroup_id` | `CgroupID` | `cgroup_id` | `CGROUP_ID` |
| Cgroup CSS address | `<subsystem>_css_addr` | `<Subsystem>CSSAddr` | `<subsystem>_css_addr` | `<SUBSYSTEM>_CSS_ADDR` |
| Network namespace inode | `netns_inum` | `NetNamespaceInum` | `net_namespace_inum` | `NETNS_INUM` |
| Network namespace cookie | `netns_cookie` | `NetNamespaceCookie` | `net_namespace_cookie` | `NETNS_COOKIE` |
| Network device index | `ifindex` or `<name>_ifindex` | `Ifindex` or `<Name>Ifindex` | `ifindex` or `<name>_ifindex` | `IFINDEX` |

Kernel terms `inum` and `ifindex` remain single words in Go. Do not split them
into `INum` or `IfIndex`. User-facing Go and JSON fields expand `netns` to
`NetNamespace` and `net_namespace`.

## Observation times and compatibility

`kernel_observed_timestamp`, `observed_timestamp`, and `uploaded_timestamp`
represent kernel observation, userspace observation, and storage write time.
Kernel observation means the hook execution time, which may differ from the
onset of a physical hardware error or network fault.

Document stores UTC timestamps at the top level and excludes
`kernel_observed_ns`. Producers without kernel timestamps and older
documents omit `kernel_observed_timestamp`; userspace or upload timestamps must
not fill it. Historical RAS documents used `observed_timestamp` for kernel
observation, so their userspace observation time cannot be reconstructed.

New tcpshark JSON/text output replaces `ktime_ns` with
`kernel_observed_timestamp`. Upgrade tools and Agent together. Existing
documents are not rewritten or backfilled. Conversion requires the same host,
boot, and host time namespace. Historical events spanning a realtime clock
step or system suspend cannot be mapped exactly to UTC from monotonic time alone.

UTC conversion caches the monotonic-to-realtime offset. The first call one hour
after the last successful sample refreshes it; ordinary calls do not extend
its lifetime. Sampling failures are returned and retried on the next call.
Realtime clock steps and system suspend do not trigger an early refresh; the
offset is updated on the first call after the cache expires.
