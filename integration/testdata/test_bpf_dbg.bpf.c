// Fixture for integration/test_basic_bpf_debug_macro.sh. Compiled twice via
// build/clang.sh — once with -DDEBUG_BPF, once without — to verify that
// bpf/include/bpf_dbg.h gates code emission as documented. Not referenced
// by any //go:generate, so the main build never sees it.
//
// Uses the project's vmlinux.h (not <linux/bpf.h>) because bpf_dbg.h
// pulls in bpf_common.h which uses kernel types like u32 that live in
// vmlinux.h. This also keeps the fixture aligned with how production
// BPF objects are built, so it exercises the real include path.
