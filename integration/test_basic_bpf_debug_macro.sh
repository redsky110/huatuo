# Verify the two-stage gating in bpf/include/bpf_dbg.h: with -DDEBUG_BPF the
# bpf_dbg_msg() body must be emitted into the .o; without it, the macro
# collapses to (void) casts and leaves no trace. The fixture is compiled
# twice via the project's own build/clang.sh — exercising the real
# BPF_EXTRA_CFLAGS contract — then `strings` checks for a unique marker.
